# CMML3_ICA1
This mini-project investigates the effect of mutations on the inhibition of subtilisin by chymotrypsin inhibitor 2 (CI2). By combining homology modelling, protein interface analysis (PDBePISA) and structural visualization tools (PyMOL), I have identified key residues, I: Met59 and I: Tyr61, as the major contributors to the 'clogged gutter' mechanism. Mutation analysis suggests that their replacement may significantly affect deacylation efficiency and inhibitor potency.
